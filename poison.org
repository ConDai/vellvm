* When does poison cause undefined behaviour?

  - Branching on poison is undefined behaviour.
    + select does NOT raise UB.
  - Store to poison address is UB
  - Load from poison address is UB

* Evaluation and poison

  Evaluation of expressions depending on poison should yield poison as
  well... This mostly appears in DynamicValues.v, like for instance in
  eval_icmp... Normally this would result in a type error being raised
  if the types don't match up, but poison erases type information...

* Select and poison

  If any operand of select is poison the result is poison.

  "An instruction that depends on a poison value, produces a poison value itself."

  Even if the select chooses the non-poison value.

* Vectors and poison

  Considered pointwise, I think.

* When to Pick?

  Attempt to pick a value when undef is in a crucial place. Such places are:

  - divisor
