(** * Scoping
    We define through this file several functions and predicates having to do with the scope
    of VIR programs, w.r.t. both block identifiers and local variables.
    We unfortunately inherit from LLVM IR a fully named representation of variables, forcing
    on us fairly heavy sanity checks.
    - [inputs]: input labels of an [ocfg]
    - [outputs]: output labels of an [ocfg]
    - [wf_ocfg_bid]: no duplicate block identifiers


 *)

(** * Well-formedness w.r.t. block identifiers
    An [ocfg] should not admit any collisions w.r.t. to its labels.

     Collect the list of input labels in an open control flow graph.
     Denoting an [ocfg] starting from a label out of this static list
     always results in the identity.

     Collect the list of output labels in an open control flow graph.
     Denoting an [ocfg] starting from a label that belongs to its [inputs]
     will always result in a label in the static [output] list, or in a value.

      irrelevant.

  (** * no reentrance
      Generally speaking, all blocks in an open cfg are mutually recursive,
      we therefore can never discard part of the graph without further assumption.
      We would however still like to capture the idea that two parts of the graph
      represent two distinct computations that are executed in sequence.
      This is expressed by observing that the second sub-graph cannot jump back
      into the first one, i.e. that the [outputs] of the former do not intersect
      with the [inputs] of the latter.

      Under this assumption, the first part of the graph can be safely discarded
      once the second part is reached: cf [DenotationTheory.denote_ocfg_app_no_edges] 
      notably.

  (** * independent
      While [no_reentrance] captures two sequential computations,
      [independent_flows] captures two completely disjoint sub-graphs.
      This typically allows us to reason in a modular fashion about
      the branches of a conditional.
